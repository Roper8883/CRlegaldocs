      <h2>1) Acceptance</h2>
      <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the app, you agree to these Terms.</p>

      <h2>2) Educational Purpose and RTO Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>CapstoneReady is an educational preparation and training support tool only. Spark's Capstone Ready is <strong>not</strong> a Registered Training Organisation (RTO). The app does not deliver accredited training, issue qualifications, or grant licensing outcomes.</p>

      <h2>3) User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the app lawfully and responsibly.</li>
        <li>Maintain device/account security.</li>
        <li>Do not bypass payment controls, entitlements, or app security controls.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Free and Premium Access</h2>
      <p>Free access includes limited content. Premium access unlocks additional question banks and related features while entitlement is active (current paid release: General Knowledge Premium).</p>
      <p>Other premium banks may be temporarily unavailable while content is rebuilt.</p>

      <h2>5) Premium Plans and Billing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Premium is purchased through Apple In-App Purchase.</li>
        <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID.</li>
        <li>Current premium offer: <strong>10-week Premium Pass</strong>.</li>
        <li>The 10-week pass expires at end of term unless purchased again.</li>
        <li>The 10-week pass does <strong>not</strong> auto-renew.</li>
        <li>If additional plans are introduced, they will be disclosed in-app and in updated terms.</li>
        <li>Restore Purchases is available in-app.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Paid Banner Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>The app includes future-ready sponsored banner infrastructure, currently disabled by default. If activated in a future release, updated disclosures may apply.</p>

      <h2>7) Profile Data Access Restrictions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Weekly profile PDF delivery is restricted to the signed-in learner and linked employer recipients.</li>
        <li>SRTO/RTO access to learner data is allowed only through subscribed, consented, authenticated portal workflows.</li>
        <li>Any SRTO/RTO use, storage, copying, forwarding, analytics, or system ingestion requires prior written permission from Spark's Capstone Ready and an active paid RTO subscription.</li>
        <li>Unauthorised access or use of learner profile data is prohibited.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8) Creator Override Access</h2>
      <p>Configured creator identities may receive internal override access for operational testing/support. Standard customer premium terms remain unchanged.</p>

      <h2>9) RTO Subscription Separation</h2>
      <p>Any future RTO portal subscription is separate from learner premium access. Learner premium purchase does not grant RTO portal access, and RTO subscription does not grant learner premium entitlements.</p>

      <h2>10) Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>App code, branding, UI, and original content are owned by Spark's Capstone Ready or licensed for use. Unauthorised reproduction or commercial use is prohibited.</p>

      <h2>11) Standards and Calculation Tools</h2>
      <p>The app does not reproduce protected standards text. Scientific and electrical calculation tools are study support aids only. Users must verify final values against current standards, workplace procedures, and assessor requirements.</p>

      <h2>12) External Links</h2>
      <p>The app may open external links, including YouTube tutorial links and social channels. Third-party platforms are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</p>

      <h2>13) Security and Availability</h2>
      <p>We apply security controls including sign-in and periodic device presence verification checks during signed-in sessions (biometric where available), and may modify features for maintenance, legal, security, or product reasons.</p>

      <h2>14) Disclaimers and Liability</h2>
      <p>The app is provided on an “as is” basis. To the extent permitted by law, Spark's Capstone Ready is not liable for indirect or consequential loss arising from app use.</p>

      <h2>15) Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by Australian law and applicable state/territory courts.</p>

      <h2>16) Updates</h2>
      <p>We may update these terms. Continued use after updates means you accept the revised terms.</p>

      <h2>17) Account Deletion</h2>
      <p>You can delete your app account state and local app data in-app at any time via <strong>Settings -&gt; Data -&gt; Delete Account &amp; Data</strong>.</p>
      <p>Deletion removes app account/data from CapstoneReady and does not delete your Apple/Google/Facebook provider account.</p>
