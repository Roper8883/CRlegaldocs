      <p>These terms apply to CapstoneReady provided by <strong>Spark's Capstone Ready</strong> (Australia). Contact: <strong>capstoneready@outlook.com</strong>.</p>

      <h2>1) Educational Purpose and RTO Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>CapstoneReady is a preparation/training support app only. Spark's Capstone Ready is <strong>not</strong> a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) and does not issue accredited outcomes.</p>

      <h2>2) Premium and Billing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Premium purchases are processed by Apple via your Apple ID.</li>
        <li>Current paid learner release: <strong>General Knowledge Premium</strong>.</li>

      <h2>3) Premium vs RTO Subscription</h2>
      <p>Learner premium and any future RTO portal subscription are separate products with separate billing and access rights.</p>

      <h2>4) Profiling Workflow and Sign-Off</h2>
      <p>The profiling workflow supports learner draft/evidence capture, employer-device biometric approval, and on-device signature plus biometric sign-off. Electronic workflow records are operational evidence for the app workflow and do not by themselves replace external legal or regulatory obligations.</p>

      <h2>5) Delivery Audit and Workflow Status</h2>
      <p>Profile dispatch statuses are <strong>Queued</strong>, <strong>Sent</strong>, <strong>Delivered</strong>, and <strong>Failed</strong>. A per-profile in-app audit trail may include retry attempt metadata.</p>

      <h2>6) Monthly Compliance Exception Flags</h2>
      <p>Monthly exception flags are calculated using fixed workflow rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Missing signatures</li>
        <li>Late submissions (after week-end plus grace period)</li>
        <li>Incomplete sections</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are workflow indicators only and do not replace legal advice or regulator determinations.</p>

      <h2>7) Profile Data Restrictions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Profile document delivery is restricted to signed-in learner and linked employer recipient workflows.</li>
        <li>SRTO/RTO access is permitted only through contracted, consented, authenticated workflows.</li>
        <li>SRTO/RTO use/storage/copying/ingestion without prior written permission from Spark's Capstone Ready and an active commercial agreement is prohibited.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8) Tamper-Evident Records and Verification</h2>
      <p>Profile exports are designed with tamper-evident controls including hash and verification metadata.</p>

      <h2>9) Standards and Tools Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>The app does not reproduce protected standards text. Built-in calculators and learning tools are study aids only. Users remain responsible for verifying final values and compliance obligations.</p>

      <h2>10) Security and Availability</h2>
      <p>The app uses sign-in and periodic presence verification controls (biometric where available). Features may be modified for legal, security, maintenance, or product reasons.</p>

      <h2>11) Account Deletion</h2>
      <p>In-app deletion path: <strong>Profile icon -&gt; Account &amp; Data -&gt; Delete Account &amp; Data</strong>.</p>

      <h2>12) Liability</h2>
      <p>To the extent permitted by law, the app is provided "as is" and Spark's Capstone Ready is not liable for indirect or consequential loss arising from use.</p>

      <h2>13) Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by Australian law.</p>
