      <p><strong>Compliance notice:</strong> Spark's Capstone Ready is not a Registered Training Organisation (RTO). CapstoneReady is used for preparation and training support only.</p>

      <h2>1) Scope</h2>
      <p>This policy explains how personal information is handled in CapstoneReady in an Australian context and aligned to the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

      <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple Sign-In identifiers and profile fields provided by Apple.</li>
        <li>Google/Facebook/email sign-in identifiers where those providers are used.</li>
        <li>Learning progress records, including quiz attempts, scores, module completion, and readiness status.</li>
        <li>Weekly profiling records entered by users, including recipient emails and supervisor signature data where provided.</li>
        <li>Notification center and messaging metadata used for inbox sync, signature workflow, and tutorial reminders.</li>
        <li>Premium entitlement status and transaction state from Apple StoreKit.</li>
        <li>Tutorial booking data (for example topic, tutor details, session time, and status events).</li>
        <li>Support details supplied in support requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) How We Collect Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Directly from users when signing in, using quiz/profiling features, or contacting support.</li>
        <li>Automatically from app interactions required for feature operation.</li>
        <li>From Apple, Google, Facebook, and configured identity services for authentication and purchase entitlement checks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Why We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide account access and core app functionality.</li>
        <li>Track learning progress and readiness.</li>
        <li>Deliver profile export/distribution workflows to user-selected recipients.</li>
        <li>Verify, activate, and restore premium entitlement.</li>
        <li>Maintain premium entitlement windows for purchased premium access (currently a non-renewing 10-week pass).</li>
        <li>Support notifications and workflow events across profiling, messaging, and tutorial booking.</li>
        <li>Apply security controls and maintain app stability/support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>Progress and profiling records are stored locally on-device. Sensitive local payloads are encrypted at rest using platform security features (including Keychain-backed keys where available). During signed-in sessions, periodic device presence verification checks are enforced (biometric where available).</p>

      <h2>6) Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell personal information. Information may be shared with Apple, Google, Facebook, and essential service components needed to run app features, or where required by law.</p>

      <h2>7) Overseas Disclosure</h2>
      <p>Some services may process limited information outside Australia. Where used, we seek providers with appropriate safeguards.</p>

      <h2>8) Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>The app may open external services such as YouTube links for tutorial content. Third-party platforms operate under their own privacy policies and terms.</p>

      <h2>9) Access and Correction</h2>
      <p>Requests for access or correction can be sent to <strong>capstoneready@outlook.com</strong>.</p>
      <p>You can also delete your app account state and local app data in-app via <strong>Settings -> Data -> Delete Account &amp; Data</strong>.</p>
      <p>Deleting app account data does not delete your Apple/Google/Facebook provider account, which remains managed by that provider.</p>

      <h2>10) Premium and RTO Subscription Separation</h2>
      <p>The learner premium pass and any future RTO portal subscription are separate products. A learner premium purchase does not grant RTO portal access, and an RTO portal subscription does not grant learner premium entitlements.</p>

      <h2>11) Complaints</h2>
      <p>If you have a privacy complaint, contact <strong>capstoneready@outlook.com</strong> with details. We will investigate and respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

      <h2>12) Retention</h2>
      <p>Information is retained only while required for app operation, legal obligations, or support. Users can reset local app data from in-app settings or use the in-app account deletion control.</p>

      <h2>13) Updates</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy. The current version and effective date are shown on this page.</p>
