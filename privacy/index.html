      <p class="meta">Version 1.7 | Effective date: 1 March 2026</p>
      <p>CapstoneReady is provided by <strong>Spark's Capstone Ready</strong> (Australia). Contact: <strong>capstoneready@outlook.com</strong>.</p>
      <p>Primary website: <a href="https://capstoneready.github.io/CapstoneReady/">https://capstoneready.github.io/CapstoneReady/</a> | Legal docs mirror: <a href="https://roper8883.github.io/CRlegaldocs/">https://roper8883.github.io/CRlegaldocs/</a></p>
      <p><strong>Compliance notice:</strong> Spark's Capstone Ready is not a Registered Training Organisation (RTO). CapstoneReady is preparation/training support only.</p>

      <h2>1) Scope</h2>
      <p>This policy explains how personal information is handled in CapstoneReady.</p>

      <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sign-in identifiers and account/session state.</li>
        <li>Learning progress and quiz/module readiness records.</li>
        <li>Profiling workflow data including weekly entries and sign-off state.</li>
        <li>Notification and messaging metadata for delivery and retry workflows.</li>
        <li>Tutorial booking workflow metadata.</li>
        <li>Region/locale preferences and, where permission is granted, approximate location for regional content routing.</li>
        <li>StoreKit transaction and entitlement state for premium access.</li>
        <li>Security/diagnostic metadata needed for support and reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Why We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and secure app access.</li>
        <li>Operate learning, quiz, tools, profiling, and messaging features.</li>
        <li>Manage premium entitlement windows (current paid offer is a non-renewing 10-week pass).</li>
        <li>Generate and dispatch profile documents to the signed-in learner and linked employer recipient.</li>
        <li>Maintain delivery audit/retry trails and service reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>Data is stored on-device first. Where enabled and available, app records may sync through Apple iCloud services for recovery across reinstalls/devices. Sensitive local payloads use platform security controls (including Keychain-backed key handling where available). Sensitive actions can require explicit confirmation and biometric verification where supported.</p>

      <h2>5) Profile Data Access Restrictions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Profile document delivery is restricted to signed-in learner and linked employer recipient workflows.</li>
        <li>SRTO/RTO access is restricted to contracted, consented, authenticated workflows.</li>
        <li>SRTO/RTO use/storage/ingestion without prior written permission from Spark's Capstone Ready and an active commercial agreement is prohibited.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Profiling Document Security</h2>
      <p>Profile exports are designed with branding, workflow evidence fields, and tamper-evident elements (such as hash metadata). No digital system can guarantee absolute prevention of misuse; recipients remain responsible for lawful handling.</p>

      <h2>7) Access, Correction, and Deletion</h2>
      <p>Contact: <strong>capstoneready@outlook.com</strong></p>
      <p>In-app deletion path: <strong>Profile icon -&gt; Account &amp; Data -&gt; Delete Account &amp; Data</strong>.</p>
      <p>Deleting app account/data does not delete provider accounts (Apple/Google/Facebook).</p>

      <h2>8) Updates</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy. The current version and effective date are shown on this page.</p>
